## Decision Tree using PySpark

The goal of the project was to use decision trees using PySpark. The first step was to prepare and adapt the data to a format accepted by PySpark, including cleansing and transformation. Then, the decision tree model was built and its parameters, such as the tree depth and the division criterion, were adjusted to obtain optimal prediction.

During the forecasting process, the model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and ROC curve. The implementation in PySpark focused on the use of `pyspark.ml.DecisionTreeClassifier` which allowed for a more practical application of decision trees in a specific case.
